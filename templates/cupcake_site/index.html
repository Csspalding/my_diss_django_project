{% comment %} You might want to try one hour of code a day, or 20 minutes a day or one hour a week. You might think you prefer learning face to face, there are a few organisation listed that offer coding workshops and classes for free. If you have access to a PC why not try out the free courses as well, you might surprise yourself.  {% endcomment %}
{% comment %} You may want to check out formal certified Computer Science course at your local college or university. And if you get stuck on a project, support is out there, chances are other people have experienced the same problem, and there's an answer posted someone on the internet. Also look out for Meet Up Groups in your area who offer beginers help with their projects.  {% endcomment %}
