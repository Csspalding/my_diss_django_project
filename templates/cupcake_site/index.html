<p>Check out Learning Tools <a href="{% url 'cupcake_site:tools' %}" >Click Here</a>. Like cakes? I'm sure you've baked a few cupcakes over time, so you might just suprise yourself and be able to learn to code. There is an amazing quantity of resources available on-line and free guidance on offer. Once you get started, like baking cakes, it's actually pretty addictive. </p>
<p>If you are like me then you're good at organising, keeping things clean, and being adaptable to fit around others. Applying your life skills and learning to code could make you more employable in the future. The great thing about coding is nobody knows it all, and there's always something new to learn. I've found coding suprisingly creative and you could too!

{% comment %} You might want to try one of code a week, or 20 minutes a day. You might think you prefer learning face to face, there are a few organisation listed that offer coding workshops and classes for free. If you have access to a PC why not try out the free courses as well, you might surprise yourself.  {% endcomment %}
{% comment %} You may want to check out formal certified Computer Science course at your local college or university. And if you get stuck on a project, support is out there, chances are other people have experienced the same problem, and there's an answer posted someone on the internet. Also look out for Meet Up Groups in your area who offer beginers help with their projects.  {% endcomment %}
